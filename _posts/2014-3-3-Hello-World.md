Pepper is a wearable augmented reality computer with brain-computer intereface sensors. 

Augmented reality is building using CLD and reflective display, as well as object tracking and recognition. 

The brain-computer interface is done using dry EEG sensors. All analog singal is processed in chip or in cloud using signal processing and machine learning trainning and predicting algorithms.
